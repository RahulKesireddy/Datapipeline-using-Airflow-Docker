DATA PIPELINE USING APACHE AIRFLOW AND DOCKER

In this project, we developed a robust data pipeline for extracting and analyzing Twitter sentiment using various advanced tools and methodologies. The pipeline performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and patterns, followed by sentiment extraction and classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories. We leveraged SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) to enhance the sentiment analysis model, ensuring precise identification of relevant entities within the tweets. Apache Airflow was employed for orchestration and scheduling, enabling efficient and automated workflow management. Docker was utilized for containerization, ensuring consistency and scalability across different environments. This integration of technologies allowed us to build a scalable and efficient sentiment analysis model, capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of Twitter data. The result is a highly automated, containerized pipeline that reliably extracts and models tweet sentiments, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends.
