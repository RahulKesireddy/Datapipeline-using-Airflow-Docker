DATA PIPELINE USING APACHE AIRFLOW AND DOCKER

In this project, a comprehensive data pipeline for Twitter sentiment extraction has been meticulously crafted, integrating analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling techniques. Leveraging Spacy's powerful Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities, the pipeline adeptly identifies entities within the tweets, enhancing understanding and context. Orchestrated and scheduled seamlessly through Apache Airflow, the pipeline ensures efficient and timely execution of tasks. Embracing containerization principles, Docker encapsulates the entire data pipeline, fostering portability and reproducibility across different environments. The pipeline adeptly discerns between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments within tweets, facilitating nuanced analysis and insights generation. Through iterative modeling processes, the pipeline refines its sentiment classification abilities, continually enhancing accuracy and reliability. This holistic approach to sentiment extraction from Twitter data underscores the fusion of cutting-edge technologies and robust methodologies in the realm of data engineering and analysis.
